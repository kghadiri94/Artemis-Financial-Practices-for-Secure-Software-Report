# Artemis-Financial-Practices-for-Secure-Software-Report
#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial was the client. Their goal was to implement a current and effective software security for their website and clients. This included adding HTTPS and utilizing checksums and securing the code.

#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I think I did a good job and ensuring everything Artemis wanted was addressed and implemented. Software security is pivotal in todays world due to the high amount of threat you are exposed to on a daily basis. Customers, especially those sharing personal and financial information, expect their information to remain safe and secure when operating Artemis Financials website and application.

#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Locating all the dependencies was a little difficult as this was my first time doing this. It is also helpful, as knowing how to identify these will be crucial in the future.

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Implementing HTTPS, Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Secure Hashing Algorithms were all crucial pieces of the puzzle and helped keep the information stored secure in various ways.

#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new 
vulnerabilities?
The Maven dependency check was important in the testing periods and I would generate a report and check data. Checksum verifications were important as well.

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Everything used in this course will be helpful in the future, but to be specific the maven dependency checks, learning how to generate a cerificate, and implementing a secure HTTPS connection were noteworthy.

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Future employers will be able to see an example of my work in the field of software security. Showing my knowledge of checking and addressing dependencies, chaning to the more secure HTTPS, securing code, and generating cerifications.
